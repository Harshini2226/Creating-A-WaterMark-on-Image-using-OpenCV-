# Creating-A-WaterMark-on-Image-using-OpenCV-

# Introduction:

We are now making watermarking images using OpenCV in Python in this project. Watermark is looking left Text/logo onto the image. This helps us to identify the actual developer of an artist. Watermarks are used to protect the copyright of the picture. watermarks sometimes work as branding & marketing for the company or as an individual.

A watermark is a logo, signature, text, or pattern that is intentionally onto different images and is used to protect the copyright of the photos & branding. The primary purpose of Watermarking is to promote a brand. After watermarking, a picture is too difficult to copy or use the original image without the company & developerâ€™s permission. 

Before giving watermarking to the vision we have to OpenCV module install in your system. OpenCV is a python library that provides various features. it is easy to use and does not need any setup.

# How To Run The Code :
1. Open any python code editor and paste the code below
2. after that need to install the OpenCV python library
3.  open your command prompt and hit the command below
4. pip install OpenCV-python 
5. Click on the run and run the code

   # Output:
